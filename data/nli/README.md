run the following two commands from this folder on 
your terminal (you might be missing wget on your mac):



wget http://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/multinli/multinli_1.0.zip .
wget http://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/multinli/snli_1.0.zip .

decompress both zips here, so you get the following paths
.../pytorchfriday/data/nlk/snli_1.0
.../pytorchfriday/data/nlk/multnli_1.0
